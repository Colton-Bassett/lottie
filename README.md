# "Lottie" Prototype

Lottie is a project designed to learn
[Lottie Animations](https://lottiefiles.com/), an innovative animation tool for
seamless web and mobile integration. This project also dives into
[Redux](https://redux.js.org/), a tool for managing app data and state with
React. And we explore UI design principles inspired by
[Figma](https://www.figma.com/), a popular collaboration tool trusted by
designers worldwide.

Lottie library: https://gamote.github.io/lottie-react/

Visibility Sensor: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-visibility-sensor

This project was created with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Goals

-   Gain proficiency in creating and using Lottie Animations to enhance the user
    experience of web and mobile applications.

-   Learn Redux to effectively manage application state and streamline data flow
    within projects.

-   Explore and implement UI design principles inspired by the Figma's design
    team, aiming to create beautiful and user-friendly interfaces.

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best
performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can
`eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from
your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive
dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have
full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but
they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point
you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for
small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this
feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t
customize it when you are ready for it.
